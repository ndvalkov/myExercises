	<textarea name="txt" id="textArea" cols="100" rows="10">AbbaPalindroLamaLmes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Avid Diva, a city buried by ash in that year. This palindrome, called the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: "Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas" ("The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically Amore, Roma. from either top left to ABBA bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, "A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama" they can be referred to as palindromatic.
